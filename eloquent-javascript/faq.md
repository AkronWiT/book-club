**Q) Where do you meet?**

A) At the Mustard Seed Cafe in Highland Square. If the weather allows, we will try to grab space outside.


**Q) What is the format of the meetups?**

A) We will discuss chapter content and compare our code from the exercises at the end of each chapter. The purpose of this is to challenge how we think about the code we write and how we approach solving problems. We seek to learn as much from each other as from the book.

**Q) Where can I get the book?**

A) You can purchase a physical copy, or you can read for free online. Both options are available on the [Eloquent JavaScript website](http://eloquentjavascript.net/).

**Q) How do I know when the meetings happen?**

A) Our first event is posted on Meetup [here](http://www.meetup.com/Akron-Women-In-Tech/events/229180113/). To be notified of upcoming events, join our Meetup group and make sure your notifications are enabled for AkronWiT.


**Q) I have more questions!**

A) You can email the organizer at rachel.krantz@akronwit.org for more information.
